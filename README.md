seat heating application using Embedded C

## Introduction
In the era of automation, every individual is looking for comfort and advanced technologies.In many countries there is a vast need of heating system in vehicles due to low temp outside.In this project the automated heating system the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a LCD display will show requested the temperature. In our project we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and LCD diplay,etc.
## Features
- The Sensor will sense wether any person is inside the vehicle or not.
- Tempeature can be controlled manually by the driver or passengers.
- Suitable to use in countries with low temperatures basically in negative.
- Low cost and robust system.
